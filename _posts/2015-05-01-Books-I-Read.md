This is a list of books I've recently read or I am still reading. The “problem” I'm having is that I start reading more books at once instead of one by one, since I perform very badly in multitasking, but if something interests me I start it immediately. 

Programming: 

- Professional PHP Design Patterns - Aaron Saray
- Build APIs You Won't Hate - Phil Sturgeon
- Practical Design Patterns in PHP - Brandon Savage
- The Book for Symfony 2.5
- Scaling PHP Applications - Steve Corona
