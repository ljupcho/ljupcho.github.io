How far can you see? How does experience help in being able to see how things play out?
What do you do when you get a problem that opens up a problem that opens up a problem, but you can only see 1 or 2 levels ahead? What do you do when you start feeling you maybe chosen the wrong path of solving the problem, should one stick to it just because spent so many time making it? And at what point do you feel satisfied with the situations, how does a perfect solution feel like (or at-least nearly perfect solution)?

Most of the times I get to say I am tired of these imperfect products I am building, oh well at least I love the process that is something right! And there is this uneasiness, the thought comes back and back to the problem and the urge to fix it, looking at it from different angles and the occasional thoughts that might be the potential solutions that would give a little rest. Seems more like a thoughts coming back to me for solving a problem. But they also say it can't be solved by thinking, only by allowing. The process of working should not be thinking but sensing and going into the more revealing path. And now this gets a bit tricky. The only good solution is the one you don't remember the next day. If the thoughts comes back to you, you are convincing that you did all you could and at that time it is the best solution. Not true. Instinct is the first level, intelligence is the second level and the intuition is the highest level. Only by allowing the intuition to guide you, you could bring the solution home, only then you get to get a morning without thinking of that damn problem. It should cut like a knife ... without blinking an eye. There's also another way, solving or more like forgetting about a problem by creating a bigger one. That's sounds more familiar. But in the end and in most cases the solutions just comes as a download, a thought unexpected, simple and unique, it comes on its own and becomes self-evident and the thinking stops. Silence.

A small poem if you will:

Never ever follow any leader they are lost too. 

Never be a junior, mid or senior you're just a developer and your only job is to make it work. 

Never let your guard down and your confidence shrink, managers are lying to you.

The mind is dis-functional it needs training, lots of training. 

No such thing as pair-programming or team work, the only way to upgrade your skills is by reading, alone.

Never use technology without awareness, make sure you know what it is doing to you, otherwise it will only straighten your ego.
