Hello!

I am a Software Developer, coming from Skopje, Macedonia. Most of my time I spend coding in PHP with different frameworks, but I also like doing my own designs and small frameworks that can be case specific.

The idea of the blog is to publish research work from measuring performances of different technologies, comparing them and draw up some conclusions and take it from there. Occasionally I will find the liberty to write an opinion or two about certain things that bother me, IT related stuff. The thing is that sometimes it takes a lot of time to master something and a bit more to compare it with something else.

I enjoy running, biking in nature and meditation.

You can follow me on twitter [@ljupcho3a](https://twitter.com/ljupcho3a) or [e-mail](mailto:ljupcho.apostolov@gmail.com)

Thanks for reading!
